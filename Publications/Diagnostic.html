        <h4>Abstract </h4>
        <p class="c1">
            This Demonstration compares the ratios of the areas under the curve (AUC) and the ratios of the areas over the curve (AOC) of the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#ROC_plots" title="glossary: ROC plots">
                receiver
                operating characteristic
            </a> (ROC) plots of two diagnostic tests (ratio of the AUC of the first test to the AUC of the second test: blue plot, ratio of the AOC of the first test to the AOC of the second test: orange plot). The two tests measure the same measurand, for normally distributed nondiseased and diseased populations, for various values of the mean and standard deviation of the populations, and of the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Measurement_Uncertainty" title="glossary:  measurement uncertainty">uncertainty of measurement</a> of the tests. A normal distribution of the uncertainty is assumed. The uncertainty of the first test is defined. It is assumed that the uncertainty of the second test is greater than the uncertainty of the first test and varies up to a user defined upper bound. The six parameters that you can vary using the sliders are measured in arbitrary units.
        </p>
        <h4>Comment</h4>
        <p class="c1">
            The area under a ROC curve is used as an index of the diagnostic accuracy of the respective test. The relative change of the area over the curve against the uncertainty of measurement is greater than the absolute value of the relative change of the area under the curve. Therefore, although the uncertainty of measurement has little effect on the diagnostic accuracy of the test, it has a considerably greater effect on its diagnostic inaccuracy.
        </p>
        <p class="c1">
            To the best of our knowledge, measures of the area over the ROC curve against the uncertainty of measurement have not been discussed in the literature.

            diagnostic tests. The two tests measure the same measurand, for normally

            <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Prevalence" title="glossary: prevalence">prevalence</a> of the disease, of the mean and standard deviation of the

            standard deviation of each population and the uncertainty of each test are
            measured in arbitrary units. The measures compared are the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Positive_Predictive_Value" title="glossary: positive predictive value">positive predictive value</a> (PPV), the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Negative_Predictive_Value" title="glossary: negative predictive value">negative predictive value</a> (NPV), the
            (diagnostic) odds ratio (OR), the likelihood ratio for a positive result (LR+),

            calculated versus the sensitivity or the specificity of each test. That can be
            selected by pressing the respective button. The types of plot are: both
            measures (first test: blue plot, second test: orange plot), partial derivatives
            of both measures with respect to uncertainty (first test: blue plot, second
            test: orange plot), difference, and ratio of the two measures. The types of

            This Demonstration shows calculations of point estimations and confidence intervals for various accuracy measures of a diagnostic test for a disease. This is done for differing negative and positive test results of nondiseased and diseased populations and differing <span class="c7"><em>p</em></span>-values for the estimations of the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals. The calculated measures are the sensitivity, the specificity, the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Positive_Predictive_Value" title="glossary: positive predictive value">positive predictive value</a> ("PPV"), the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Negative_Predictive_Value" title="glossary: negative predictive value">negative predictive value</a> ("NPV"), the (diagnostic) odds ratio ("OR"), the likelihood ratio for a positive test result ("LR+"), and the likelihood ratio for a negative test result ("LR-"). The measures can be selected using the menu. The negative and positive test results of the nondiseased and diseased populations, along with the <span class="c7"><em>p</em></span>-value, are chosen using the sliders.
        </p>
        <h4>Comment</h4>
        <p class="c1">
            The Wilson score method with continuity correction is used for calculating the confidence intervals of the sensitivity, the specificity, the positive predictive value and the negative predictive value. For the calculation of the confidence intervals of the (diagnostic) odds ratio, the likelihood ratio for a positive test result and the likelihood ratio for a negative test result, it is assumed that their natural logarithms have asymptotically normal distributions.

        <p class="c1">
            This Demonstration plots the change, the relative change, the rate of change, and the relative rate of change of the area under (blue plot) and the area over (orange plot) the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#ROC_plots" title="glossary: ROC plots">

The test measures a measurand on normally distributed nondiseased and diseased populations, for various values of the mean and standard deviation of the populations. A normal distribution of the uncertainty is assumed. The type of plot is selected using the "plot" menu. The five parameters that can be varied using the sliders are measured in arbitrary units.
        </p>
        <h4>Comment</h4>
        <p class="c1">
            The area under a ROC curve is used as an index of the diagnostic accuracy of the respective test. Assuming <span class="c7"><em>AUC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>) is the area under the ROC curve and <span class="c7"><em>AOC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>) is the area over the ROC curve for an uncertainty of measurement u, we have <span class="c7"><em>AOC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>) = 1 - <span class="c7"><em>AUC</em></span>(<span class="c7"><em>u</em></span>). Therefore, the area over the ROC curve can be considered as an index of diagnostic inaccuracy. In fact, as the plots of this Demonstration show, the relative change, the rate of change, and the relative rate of change of the area over a ROC curve against the uncertainty of measurement are greater than the respective measures of the area under the ROC curve, for the same populations.

        <h4>Abstract </h4>
        <p class="c1">
            Screening and diagnostic tests are applied for the classification of people into diseased and non-diseased populations. Although <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Diagnostic_Accuracy" title="glossary: diagnostic accuracy">diagnostic accuracy</a> measures are used to evaluate the correctness of a classification in clinical research and practice, there has been limited research on their <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Uncertainty" title="glossary: uncertainty">uncertainty</a>. The objective for this work was to develop a tool for calculating the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures, as diagnostic accuracy is fundamental to clinical decision-making. For this reason, the freely available interactive program <span style="font-style: italic">Diagnostic Uncertainty</span> has been developed in the Wolfram Language. The program provides six modules with nine submodules for calculating and plotting the standard combined, measurement and sampling uncertainty and the resultant confidence intervals of various diagnostic accuracy measures of screening or diagnostic tests, which measure a normally distributed measurand, applied at a single point in time to samples of non-diseased and diseased populations. This is done for differing sample sizes, mean and standard deviation of the measurand, diagnostic threshold and standard measurement uncertainty of the test. The application of the program is demonstrated with an illustrative example of glucose measurements in samples of diabetic and non-diabetic populations, that shows the calculation of the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures. The presented interactive program is user-friendly and can be used as a flexible educational and research tool in medical decision-making, to calculate and explore the uncertainty of diagnostic accuracy measures.
