        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p class="c1">
            In clinical chemistry, it is assumed that the probability
            distribution of the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Analytical_Error" title="glossary: amnalytical error">analytical error</a> is normal. This assumption
            of the normality of the analytical error is implied by the successful
            application of the linearization to the analytical systems. Accordingly, the
            analytical error may be represented as the sum of many small contributions none
            of which contributes very much to the total error. Deviations from normality
            have been documented, as a number of studies shows that the probability of very
            large errors (e.g. &gt;7 standard deviations) is much greater than expected
            (Clin Chem 1997;43:1352-6). Therefore, it is possible that there are nonlinear
            components of the analytical error of some analytical systems, contributing
            substantially to the total error. Actually, it has been empirically found that
            the behavior of nonlinear <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Complex_Systems" title="glossary: complex systems">complex systems</a> is often exponential rather
            than Gaussian and their exponential <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Probability_Density_Function" title="glossary: probability density function">probability density function</a>
            (pdf) has been described (Science 1999;284:87-9). Large errors are much more
            probable with the exponential pdf than with the Gaussian. Consequently, we may
            assume that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum
            of a linear component of error with Gaussian pdf and a nonlinear component with
            exponential pdf. The pdf of the total error of these analytical systems should
            be the convolution integral of the Gaussian pdf with standard deviation
            <span class="c7">s</span>, and the exponential pdf of the absolute value of the
            nonlinear component of the error, with parameter <span class="c7">l s</span>,
            where <span class="c7">l</span> is a weighting factor. It is remarkable that
            simulated series of measurements with the proposed pdf meet the criteria for
            normality in many cases. For example, among 10,000 series of 100 measurements,
            with the proposed pdf and a weighting factor of 0.5, only 5.2% of them rejected
            the hypothesis of normality, based on the measures of skewness and kurtosis on
            the significance level of 0.01. Among 10,000 series of 1,000 such measurements
            17.4% of them rejected the same hypothesis. On the other hand, the
            probabilities that the error of those measurements exceed 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
            standard deviations are approximately 1.04, 1.7, 6.5, 62, 1551, and 103,232
            times greater than the respective probabilities of the Gaussian pdf. Assuming
            the proposed pdf and using <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Numerical_Methods" title="glossary: numerical methods">numerical methods</a>, I have estimated the
            critical errors as functions of the random and systematic errors, plotted their
            graphs, and estimated the power function graphs of various <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Quality_Control" title="glossary: quality control">quality control</a> (QC) rules, for different values of <span class="c7">l</span>. The critical errors can be significantly less than the respective ones of the
            Gaussian distribution, while the probabilities for false rejection are greater
            than the respective probabilities of the Gaussian distribution. In conclusion,
            to optimize the QC planning process, we should explore the possibility that
            there exists a nonlinear component of error, particularly when QC is applied
            upon new ultra sensitive assays and complex analytical systems. Either the
            proposed pdf could be used or alternative ones that would approximate the
            empirically found distributions of the analytical error.

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p class="c1">
            In clinical chemistry, a number of studies shows that the
            probability of very large errors is much greater than expected from the

            that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum of a
            linear component of error with Gaussian distribution and a nonlinear component with Laplacian. Then, the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Probability_Density_Function" title="glossary: probability density function">probability density function</a> (pdf) of the total error is approximated by the convolution integral of the Gaussian and the Laplacian pdf. To explore the assumption of a nonlinear
            component of the <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Analytical_Error" title="glossary: analytical error">analytical error</a>
            I have evaluated this distribution and calculated various <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Quality_Control" title="glossary: quality control">quality control</a> related statistics with <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Numerical_Methods" title="glossary: numerical methods">numerical methods</a>. Large errors are much more
            probable with the proposed distribution than with the Gaussian. Simulated
            series of measurements with the proposed distribution often meet the criteria
            for normality. The critical errors and the probabilities for critical error
            detection are less than the respective ones of the Gaussian distribution. The
            probabilities for false rejection are greater. To optimize the quality control
            planning process, we should explore the possibility that there exists a
            nonlinear component of the analytical error.
