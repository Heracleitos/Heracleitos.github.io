            the objective function to be optimized and search through large parameter
            spaces quickly. To explore the application of GAs in statistical QC, I have
            developed two interactive computer programs, based on the deterministic
            crowding genetic algorithm. Given an analytical process, the program "Optimize"
            optimizes a user defined QC procedure, while the program "Design" designs a
            novel optimized QC procedure. The programs search through the parameter space
            and find the optimal or a near-optimal solution. The possible solutions of the
            optimization problem are evaluated using computer simulation.
