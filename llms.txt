# Hellenic Complex Systems Laboratory (HCSL)

> Independent, non-profit virtual research laboratory (founded 1993, Drama, Greece) focused on uncertainty in complex systems, with emphasis on laboratory medicine: quality control, measurement uncertainty, diagnostic accuracy, and Bayesian medical diagnosis.
