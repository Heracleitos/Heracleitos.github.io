To explore the application of neural networks to samples of QC measurements of very small size, four one-dimensional (1-D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were designed, trained, and tested with datasets of n -tuples of simulated standardized normally distributed QC measurements for 1 ≤ n ≤ 4. 
	The designed neural networks were compared to statistical QC functions with equal probabilities for false rejection applied to samples of the same size. When the n -tuples included at least two QC measurements distributed as N(μ,σ^2 ), where 0.2 < |μ|  ≤ 6.0, and 1.0 < σ  ≤ 7.0, the designed neural networks outperformed the respective statistical QC functions. Therefore, 1-D CNNs applied to samples of 2-4 quality control measurements can be used to increase the probability of detection of the nonconformity of a process to the quality specifications with lower cost.
