	<meta name="citation_abstract" content="Background: In medical diagnostics, estimating post-test or posterior probabilities for disease, positive and negative predictive values, and their associated uncertainty is essential for patient care.
Objective: To introduce a software tool developed in the Wolfram Language for the parametric estimation, visualization, and comparison of Bayesian diagnostic measures and their uncertainty.
Methods: The tool employs Bayes' theorem to estimate positive and negative predictive values and posterior probabilities for the presence and absence of a disease. It estimates their standard sampling, measurement, and combined uncertainty, as well as their confidence intervals, applying uncertainty propagation methods based on first-order Taylor series approximations. It employs normal, lognormal, and gamma distributions.
Results: The software generates plots and tables of the estimates to support clinical decision-making. An illustrative case study using fasting plasma glucose data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) demonstrates its application in diagnosing diabetes mellitus. The results highlight the significant impact of measurement uncertainty on Bayesian diagnostic measures, particularly on positive predictive value and posterior probabilities.
Conclusion:  The software enhances the estimation and facilitates the comparison of Bayesian diagnostic measures, which are critical for medical practice. It provides a framework for their uncertainty quantification and assists in understanding and applying Bayes' theorem in medical diagnostics.
Keywords: Bayesian diagnosis; Bayesâ€™ theorem; prevalence; prior probability; post-test probability; posterior probability; likelihood; positive predictive value; negative predictive value; parametric distribution; combined uncertainty; measurement uncertainty; sampling uncertainty; probability density function; disease; diabetes mellitus
