            In clinical chemistry, a number of studies shows that the
            probability of very large errors is much greater than expected from the
            Gaussian distribution. In addition, it has been empirically found that the
            behavior of nonlinear <a href="../../Glossary/index.html#Complex_Systems" title="glossary: complex systems">complex systems</a> is often asymptotically exponential. Consequently, we may assume
            that the error of some analytical systems may be approximated by the sum of a
            linear component of error with Gaussian distribution and a nonlinear component with Laplacian. Then, the <a href="../../Glossary/index.html#Probability_Density_Function" title="glossary: probability density function">probability density function</a> (pdf) of the total error is approximated by the convolution integral of the Gaussian and the Laplacian pdf. To explore the assumption of a nonlinear

            I have evaluated this distribution and calculated various <a href="../../Glossary/index.html#Quality_Control" title="glossary: quality control">quality control</a> related statistics with <a href="../../Glossary/index.html#Numerical_Methods" title="glossary: numerical methods">numerical methods</a>. Large errors are much more
            probable with the proposed distribution than with the Gaussian. Simulated
