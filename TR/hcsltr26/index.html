        The role of medical diagnosis is essential in shaping therapeutic and management strategies in healthcare. Established diagnostic practices typically rely on predetermined clinical criteria and numerical thresholds. In contrast, <a href="../../Glossary/index.html#Bayesian_Inference" title="glossary: Bayesian inference">Bayesian inference</a> provides an advanced framework that supports diagnosis via detailed probabilistic analysis. This study's aim is to introduce a computational tool dedicated to the quantification of <a href="../../Glossary/index.html#Uncertainty" title="glossary: uncertainty">uncertainty</a> in the Bayesian posterior probability associated with disease detection, a field that has seen minimal exploration to date. The presented tool is a freely available, specialized computational software that utilizes uncertainty propagation techniques to derive the sampling, measurement, and combined uncertainty in the posterior probability estimates for disease. This innovative software includes two primary modules and fifteen submodules, all designed to facilitate the calculation and graphical representation of the standard uncertainty in the posterior probability estimates for various diseased and non-diseased population samples, incorporating parameters such as the mean and standard deviation of the test measurand, the size of the samples, as well as the components of standard measurement uncertainty inherent in screening and diagnostic tests. Our analysis showcases the software's practical application through the examination of fasting plasma glucose data sourced from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We validate our findings against the oral glucose tolerance test, a recognized standard in the field. Additionally, our study explores parametric distribution models to assess the uncertainty involved in Bayesian diagnosis, specifically focusing on diabetes mellitus.
