        <h4>Abstract</h4>
       <p class="c1">
                 The following musical instruments used for rhythm accompaniment were considered: guitar, toumperleki, spoon drums, bendir, baglamas, contrabass, oud, harpsichord, glass, zil, tambourine, lute, maracas, davul, saz, zither, bendir with zil, drums, castanets, accordion, kompoloi with a glass, synthesizer, tabla, crotalums, ney, electric guitar, and triangle, as well as the voice. The network encodes the use of these musical instruments in the recordings, either alone or in combination. Each vertex of the network represents an instrument. If an instrument was used alone, it is connected to itself with a loop. If it was used in combination with any other instruments, it is connected to each of them with an edge. The network is weighted. The weight of each loop or edge is the frequency of use for each instrument or combination of instruments in the recordings. The surface of each highlighted vertex is proportional to its respective measure. The calculated measures are the valences, the closeness, betweenness, degree, radiality, eccentricity, hub, authority, eigenvector and status centralities, the page ranks, the local clustering coefficients and the mean neighbor degrees.
