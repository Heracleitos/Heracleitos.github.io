                Guideline - Second Edition
            </span> recommends a quality management system for <span>in vitro</span> diagnostic test systems that is based on expert opinion, is
            practical to implement, and is applicable to various devices and settings, so
            sources of failure (potential failure modes) are identified, understood, and
            managed. This system will assist device manufacturers, regulators, accrediting
            agencies, and laboratory directors in ensuring correct results. It addresses
            regulatory considerations (eg, principles and accountability), recommends the
            development of a partnership between users and manufacturers, provides a
            source-of-failures matrix, and suggests approaches to quality
            monitoring/identification of the problems.

            manufacturers who assess clinical test accuracy. It is not a recipe; rather, it
            is a set of concepts to be used to design an assessment of test performance or
            to interpret data generated by others. In addition to the use of <a href="../Glossary/index.html#ROC_plots" title="glossary: ROC plots (curves)">ROC curves</a> and
            comparison of two curves, the document emphasizes the importance of defining
            the question, selecting a sample group, and determining the "true" clinical
            state. The statistical data generated can be useful whether one is considering
            replacing an existing test, creating or adding a new test, or eliminating a
            current test.

        <p class="c1">
            Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute document C51-A - <span class="c7">Expression of Measurement Uncertainty in Laboratory Medicine; Approved Guideline</span> describes the principles of estimating <a href="../Glossary/index.html#Measurement_Uncertainty" title="glossary: measurement uncertainty">measurement uncertainty</a> and provides guidance to clinical laboratories and in vitro diagnostic device manufacturers on the specific issues to be considered for implementation of the concept in laboratory medicine. This document illustrates the assessment of measurement uncertainty with both bottom-up and top-down approaches. The
            bottom-up approach suggests that all possible sources of uncertainty are
            identified and quantified in an uncertainty budget. A combined uncertainty is
            calculated using statistical propagation rules. The top-down approach directly
            estimates the measurement uncertainty results produced by a measuring system.
            Methods to estimate the imprecision and bias are presented theoretically and in
            worked examples.
